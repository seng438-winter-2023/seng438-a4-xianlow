# Description of figures
This is the mutation testing with **sample tests** that were provided before. However, due to a very long processing time we halted the sample test program for mutation testing. Therefore, we directly moved to doing testing with only our own test cases. We were able to understand enough well how the process worked hence the checkpoint for sample tests (which was only for practice) is at halting the pit testing.


## Figures 1.x
These are performing `junit` test to the `src` folder as before we run PIT mutation test to `org.jfree.data` it is best to ensure entire source folder has green tests. Note that we have not yet imported our own test cases to avoid interference in green test. That will only be applied once are done with PIT mutation testing with the sample cases provided. However, the sample test cases will need to be removed or the same can be done in another workspace. The test cases should not interfere and mix together, before doing mutation testing.

## Figure 2.x
These figures describe the PIT mutation testing performed on the **sample tests** provided and the test is run only in `org.jfree.data` package since `Range.java` and `DataUtilities.java` are inside that package.
