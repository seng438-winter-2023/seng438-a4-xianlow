# Introduction
In this lab, we will be breaking down two separate objectives. In the first section, we will be focusing on mutation testing which will use Pitest in the eclipse marketplace to test out our mutation coverage based on the code we have written in the previous lab. We will learn how to interpret and increase our mutation coverage which in turn will make our tests even more accurate. In the second part of this lab, we will be using Selenium to test a GUI that has been implemented by well known companies. To fully test it, it will need to check various conditions based on what is being tested. If a section of the GUI is non-functional, we will mark down what went wrong and the steps needed to reproduce the error. Since Selenium automates these tests, the steps to reproduce an error will be clearly laid out to the developers.

# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class 

# Report all the statistics and the mutation score for each test class



# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy

# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing

# Explain your SELENUIM test case design process

# Explain the use of assertions and checkpoints

# how did you test each functionaity with different test data

# Discuss advantages and disadvantages of Selenium vs. Sikulix
The main advantage of Selenium when compared to a tool like Sikulix is that is can be downloaded right on your web browser or as an individual ide. This allows the user to record the exact steps by tracking everything being done on the GUI. This includes clicking on buttons, hovering over drop-down menus, etc. Another big advantage for Selenium is that it is simple to use. Each button is intuitive and tells you exactly what it does. It will take an average user very little time to learn how to use the program. A disadvantage of the Selenium ide is that it can be very slow and sometimes crashes the web browser. Siklulix allows image recognition which can in certain situations be better when compared to Selenium since Selenium will take the HTML source code to automate the testing done. 
# How the team work/effort was divided and managed
For this lab, we have separated the work by letting two people work on the range mutation testing and the other two to work on the data utilities mutation testing. As for the GUI testing, we assigned each other to make 2 GUI automated tests on Selenium. 

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned
Within this lab, we have encountered some problems/difficulties with both parts. In the first section, since we had a high mutation coverage for data utilities, it was harder to increase the percentage and discovered that it will require tests that will be harder to implement. For the GUI testing, we were testing out the Amazon website which proves some problems. For example when testing adding items, the item is not always at the same position and also not always available which proves problems for the automation. If it can be replaced, the automation will automatically choose an item which is good but in the end will prove problems when it reaches the assert. What we have learned from this is that some manual testing or a user being there watching over the tests are sometimes required when testing an always updating GUI element. 
# Comments/feedback on the lab itself
As a whole, this lab was insightful and gave us the knowledge to further improve our test cases. For the GUI testing, we learned that Selenium can be used for automation whether it be for automated testing or just purchasing a bunch of one product. This knowledge can allow us to use this program for purposes even outside our degrees.
